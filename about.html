                        Thanks for your interest, here 
                        is a quick story of me and this 
                        website.
                        <hr color="black">
                        As a fresher engineer, I am excited to introduce myself 
                        and take my first step into the professional world.
                         I have always been fascinated by the field of engineering,
                        and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact.
                        Being a quick learner and a problem solver,
                        I believe that my theoretical knowledge and practical
                        experience make me a suitable candidate for this role.
                        
                        <hr color="black">

                        I do my work mainly in C-Language, 
                        C++ and JAVA. C++ and Data Structure
                        and Algorithm are my stronger section.
                        Besides these I know Web Development,
                        LINUX and database as well.
                        <hr color="black">

                        This website is basically one of my 
                        Web Development project which is 
                        built using HTML and CSS.
                        Here one can also find ideas for 
                        projects in different languages.

                        Thanks again for reading this, 
                        because of people like you, it 
                        exists and prospers!
